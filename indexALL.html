                <h3>What is the H-1B Visa?</h3>
                <p>H-1B visa is used by businesses and organizations in the United States to employ foreign nationals with the preferred qualifications, knowledge, and expertise in a role. The petition is filed with USCIS, along with the requisite fees.</p>
                <h3>What are the Legal Requirements for Applying for the H-1B Visa?</h3>
                <p>The application process for an H-1B visa is complex and lengthy. There are legal requirements on the employee and employer sides. To begin the process, the applicant must first find a sponsor. That sponsor must submit a Labor Conditions Approval and Form I-129.

                    Then, the employer will work with the sponsored employee to complete an H1B visa petition.</p>

                <p>Any US employer can sponsor a H1-B petition, however, it looks like big accounting/consulting firms and tech companies have higher numbers of 
                    the applications approved in past 6 years. 
                    In 2017, Amazon and Google were not in top 10.  However, in 2022, Amazon moved up to Top 1 and Google moved up to Top3.
